The website requires no installation steps from the user. The website makes use of Local Storage in the browser, so information will persist from one session to the next in the browser.

The image below shows the standard view of the Daybook with several events entered.

### Purpose of the Project
This app demonstrates several technologies used to create event planning apps. The app presumes to be used by a person conducting activities, appointments, and events during normal business hours.

### Development Aids
I received help on this project chiefly from two people:
1. My tutor, Frank Craven, was extremely helpful. He helped me learn new technologies and, in some cases, master them. Frank suggested the idea of the popup window upon saving events, as shown below.
1. My instructional assistant, Matt Torcelinni, was a steady advisor and helped me overcome coding challenges.

**Project Accomplishments:**
1. Accepts the user's events from 9am to 5pm on the present day.
1. Stores events in the browser's local storage, so the events persist from use to use, no matter how many times the browser page is refreshed or re-invoked.
1. Alerts the user when an event is saved, giving the user confidence that information is being stored.
1. Code is annotated and semantic.
1. Code is media responsive (sort of).
1. Code was validated at W3.org's code validator. No errors reported.

**Project challenges:**
1. Handling local storage.
1. Handling populating the grid from JaveScipt and jQuery code.
1. Setting up "past," "present," and "future" settings for each hour's time block.
